hsCompare is a utility and library for comparing hierarchical data structures.
It contains both abstract elements, for doing general tree comparisons, and
also specific "sources" for reading data to compare.  Examples of sources
include directories, file attributes, file archives, XML file contents, Git
repository trees, SQL schemas, SQL table contents, and also any file readable
by Augeas.  Anything that can be represented as a hierarchy can be adapted as
an hsCompare source, and then be compared to another source.

Once a source has been read into canonical form, this representation may be
stored in a disk or database and used later as source itself, allowing for
stateful comparisons.

Modes of comparison include two-way and three-way with an ancestor.  The
result is a hierarchical set of Deltas.  The granularity of the deltas depends
on the source.
